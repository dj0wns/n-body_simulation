*N-Body_Sim*

Currently this readme is a placeholder for more cool stuff to come. But here is a gif of the current progress!

**Demonstration of N-Body Sim**
This experiement consists of 1000 particles with randomized initial positions and weights but a constant radius of 10000 meters. There is a time step of 400000 seconds for 1000 repetitions. As particles collide, they are combined into a single particle where mass, area and momentum are conserved. By the 1000th frame only 40 particles remain.
