*N-Body_Sim*

Currently this readme is a placeholder for more cool stuff to come. But here is a gif of the current progress!

**Demonstration of N-Body Sim**
This demonstration consists of 2000 particles with randomized initial positions and weights. There is a time step of 400000 seconds for 400 repetitions on 4 mpi threads. Particle collision is currently not enabled because it does not work in multithreaded workloads yet.
